Started with computers since I was 12 years old with an Aquarius Computer. I loved playing and programming on my Atari 800XL,
then I reached another level when I had a Commodore 64, then an IBM PS/1 386, and everything went nuts!

I studied Computer Systems Engineering in the ITL Instituto Tecnologico de Leon.

I've been working on programming on the Internet since 1999.

I've been using Ruby ​​since 2006. After discovering Ruby on Rails, I started working on side projects for friends and acquaintances after my day job.

I program mostly in Ruby but I also can do some tricks on Javascript, Python, Elixir, and C/C++.


For me writing code is like telling a story, so I consider myself more a software writer than a programmer, currently I'm focused on applying AI to my daily workflow and doing creative coding.
