For me writing code is like telling a story, thats why I consider we are more software writers than programmers, currently I'm focused on finding new ways to apply AI to my daily workflow, experiment with interesting setups and doing some creative coding.

I program mostly in Ruby but I also can do some tricks on Javascript, Python, Elixir, and C/C++.

I've been using Ruby ​​since 2006. After discovering Ruby on Rails, I started working on side projects for friends and acquaintances after my day job. I studied Computer Systems Engineering in the ITL Instituto Tecnologico de Leon. I've been working on programming on the Internet since 1999.

Started with computers since I was 12 years old when my dad bought me an Atari 800XL Home Computer, after some years I reached another level when he gave me a Commodore 64, but when I got an IBM PS/1 386 everything went nuts!
