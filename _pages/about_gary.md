For two years, Gary Bernhardt published screencasts on various software development topics at Destroy All Software. It was very popular, but he got tired of talking to himself in a recording studio. he's now working on an unannounced product related to finance (for good, not evil). He also speak at a lot of conferences: about 25 in the last three years.
